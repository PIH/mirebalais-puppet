# fqdn = fully qualified domain name
# hostname = hostname
# to see what these resolve to on a machine that has factor installed (which the Puppet install should install) you can run:
# facter fqdn
# facter hostname
#
# this should give you the actual names that Puppet will use to look up the hiera data
# see: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/138165/determine-fqdn-when-hostname-doesnt-give-it
#
# so basically, it first looks for a file in the format {fqdn}.yaml, then {hostname}.yaml, then common.yaml
